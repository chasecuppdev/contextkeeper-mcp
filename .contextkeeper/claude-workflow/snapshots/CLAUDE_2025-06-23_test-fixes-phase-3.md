# CLAUDE.md Historical Snapshot
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Milestone**: test fixes phase 3
**Previous State**: CLAUDE_2025-06-23_documentation-cleanup.md
**Compaction Status**: Individual Snapshot

## Changes in This Version
- Fixed test isolation issues by ensuring all test classes use temp directories
- Reduced test failures from 16 to 15 (one test now passing)
- Fixed SnapshotManager to preserve full document name (CLAUDE.md not CLAUDE)
- Updated CodeAnalysis tests to use isolated environments
- Identified remaining issues with pattern matching and profile detection

## Context for Future Reference
- Test isolation is critical - shared TestData was causing pollution
- Config files created by InitializeProject were interfering with other tests
- CodeAnalysis tests need wildcard patterns (*) not regex for Roslyn APIs
- Some tests still failing due to expectations not matching Roslyn behavior

# ContextKeeper - AI Development Assistant Context

## Project Overview

ContextKeeper is an AI-powered development context management tool that implements LSM-tree inspired history tracking. It's designed to make development history accessible to AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Test Suite Status (2025-06-23 Phase 3)

### Progress Summary
- **Initial State**: 35 failing tests
- **After Phase 1**: 16 failing tests (54% improvement)
- **After Phase 2**: 15 failing tests (slight regression due to isolation issues)
- **After Phase 3**: 15 failing tests (stabilized with proper isolation)

### Key Fixes Applied in Phase 3

1. **Test Isolation Implementation**
   - Removed Environment.CurrentDirectory change from TestBase constructor
   - Updated all test classes to use CreateTempDirectory() and restore original directory
   - Fixed path resolution issues in CodeAnalysis tests
   - Ensured proper cleanup in Dispose methods

2. **SnapshotManager Document Name Fix**
   - Changed from Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension to use full filename
   - Now correctly generates "CLAUDE.md Historical Snapshot" headers

3. **Test Categories and Remaining Issues**
   - **Storage Tests (3 failures)**: Config file pollution still affecting profile detection
   - **Integration Tests (4 failures)**: Profile detection and compaction checks
   - **Snapshot Tests (2 failures)**: Validation error message format issues
   - **CodeAnalysis Tests (5 failures)**: Pattern matching and inheritance hierarchy
   - **Protocol Tests (1 failure)**: MCP server registration

### Remaining Blockers

1. **Pattern Matching Confusion**
   - Tests expect regex patterns but Roslyn uses wildcards
   - Need to update test expectations to match Roslyn behavior

2. **Config File Management**
   - InitializeProject creates config files that affect other tests
   - Need better isolation or mock configuration service

3. **Generic Type Handling**
   - FindDerivedClassesAsync failing for generic interfaces
   - Symbol documentation retrieval not working as expected

### Next Steps for Phase 4

1. Fix pattern matching tests by updating to wildcard expectations
2. Mock or isolate config file creation in tests
3. Debug generic type handling in Roslyn integration
4. Investigate MCP server registration issue
5. Create comprehensive regression test suite once all tests pass

### Lessons Learned
- Test isolation is crucial for reliable test suites
- Shared test data can cause subtle failures
- Roslyn APIs have specific behavior that tests must match
- Config files should be mocked or isolated in tests
