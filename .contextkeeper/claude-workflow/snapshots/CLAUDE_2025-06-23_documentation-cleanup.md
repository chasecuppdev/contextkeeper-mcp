# CLAUDE.md Documentation Cleanup Snapshot
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Milestone**: documentation-cleanup
**Previous State**: CLAUDE_2025-06-23_test-suite-progress.md
**Context**: Cleaned up CLAUDE.md to reflect actual test progress and current project state

## Summary of Changes

### Updated Test Status
- Changed from "55 passing, 42 failing" to accurate "65 passing, 32 failing"
- Updated test failure breakdown to reflect actual categories
- Added note about specific failure types (pattern matching, search issues)

### Added Phase 2 Progress Section
Documented what was actually accomplished in the afternoon session:
- Fixed 9 CodeAnalysis tests (reduced from 16 to 7 failures)
- Updated all path configurations to use `.contextkeeper` instead of old paths
- Fixed test data copying issues
- Identified key blockers for remaining tests

### Cleaned Up Outdated Information
- Updated implementation plan to reflect current priorities
- Changed test data section from "To create" to "Existing" with actual structure
- Added missing dependencies (Roslyn, MSBuild, MCP SDK)
- Reorganized phases to match actual progress

### Added Snapshot Workflow Documentation
- Created section explaining how to use snapshots for development
- Provided practical examples of creating and referencing snapshots
- Demonstrated the pattern we're using right now

## Key Insights

1. **Test Progress**: We made significant progress (35.4% improvement) but hit specific blockers
2. **Pattern Issues**: Roslyn uses wildcards not regex - this affects multiple tests
3. **Search Mystery**: Despite correct paths and data, search tests return 0 results
4. **Documentation Drift**: This cleanup shows how documentation can drift from reality

## Next Steps

The updated CLAUDE.md now accurately reflects:
- Current test status (65/97 passing)
- Actual blockers preventing further progress
- Completed work vs remaining work
- How to use the snapshot pattern going forward

This snapshot approach ensures future AI sessions can understand the full context and continue where we left off.
