# Test Solution for ContextKeeper Code Analysis Tests

This is a comprehensive C# test solution designed to test the CodeAnalysis features of ContextKeeper.

## Structure

### TestSolution.sln
- Root solution file containing both projects

### TestLibrary Project
A class library project containing:
- **IRepository.cs** - Generic repository interface with async methods
- **Repository.cs** - In-memory implementation of IRepository
- **IService.cs** - Service layer interface with validation
- **Service.cs** - Abstract service base class
- **Models/User.cs** - User entity with properties, methods, and UserRole enum
- **Models/Product.cs** - Product entity with various methods

### TestApp Project
A console application that references TestLibrary:
- **Program.cs** - Main entry point with demo code
- **Controllers/BaseController.cs** - Abstract base controller with logging
- **Controllers/UserController.cs** - User management with nested UserService
- **Controllers/ProductController.cs** - Product management with nested ProductService

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Various Symbol Types**
   - Interfaces (IRepository, IService)
   - Abstract classes (Service, BaseController)
   - Concrete classes (Repository, User, Product, etc.)
   - Enums (UserRole)
   - Nested classes (UserService, ProductService)

2. **Inheritance Relationships**
   - Repository<T> implements IRepository<T>
   - Service<T> implements IService<T>
   - UserController and ProductController inherit from BaseController
   - UserService and ProductService inherit from Service<T>

3. **Cross-Project References**
   - TestApp references TestLibrary
   - Controllers use models and services from TestLibrary

4. **XML Documentation**
   - All public members have XML documentation comments
   - Both projects generate documentation files

5. **Modern C# Features**
   - Nullable reference types enabled
   - Implicit usings
   - Target framework: .NET 8.0
   - Async/await patterns
   - Generic constraints
   - Expression-bodied members

## Usage in Tests

This solution provides realistic test data for:
- Symbol search and filtering
- Reference finding
- Inheritance hierarchy navigation
- Cross-project symbol resolution
- Documentation extraction
- Pattern-based searching

## Building

```bash
dotnet build
```

The solution builds with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
