# CLAUDE.md Compacted Quarterly Archive
**Quarter**: Q1 2024
**Date Range**: 2024-01-15 to 2024-03-31
**Snapshots Included**: 4
**Compaction Date**: 2024-04-01

## Quarter Summary
This quarter marked the initial development of the TaskManager API, progressing from project setup to a fully functional REST API with authentication, database integration, and comprehensive endpoints.

## Major Milestones

### January 15: Initial Setup
- Created .NET 8 Web API project structure
- Established Clean Architecture pattern
- Set up basic folder organization

### January 20: Authentication System
- Implemented JWT Bearer authentication
- Added user registration and login
- Created secure token refresh mechanism
- 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens

### January 25: Database Integration
- Integrated PostgreSQL with EF Core 8
- Implemented repository pattern
- Created domain models (User, Task, Project)
- Set up automated migrations

### February 1: API Endpoints
- Implemented full CRUD for Tasks and Projects
- Added CQRS pattern with MediatR
- Integrated pagination and filtering
- Created Swagger documentation

## Architectural Evolution

### Technology Decisions
1. **Clean Architecture**: Chosen for maintainability and testability
2. **PostgreSQL**: Selected for relational data and JSON support
3. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless, scalable authentication
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Separation of read/write operations

### Key Patterns Implemented
- Repository Pattern
- Unit of Work
- CQRS with MediatR
- Request/Response validation

## Final State Summary

### Completed Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Project management (CRUD)
- Task management with assignment
- Pagination and filtering
- API documentation
- Request validation
- Security middleware

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling
- Response caching
- Async operations throughout
- Query optimization with includes

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests: 85% coverage
- Integration tests for all endpoints
- Load tested for 1000 concurrent users

## Configuration Templates

### Connection String
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=TaskManagerDb;Username=postgres;Password=****"
}
```

### JWT Settings
```json
"JwtSettings": {
  "Secret": "[Generated]",
  "Issuer": "TaskManagerAPI",
  "Audience": "TaskManagerClient",
  "AccessTokenExpiration": 15,
  "RefreshTokenExpiration": 10080
}
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Early authentication implementation simplified security concerns
2. Generic repository pattern reduced boilerplate code
3. CQRS helped maintain clean separation of concerns
4. Comprehensive logging essential for debugging

## References for Next Quarter
- SignalR integration for real-time updates
- File attachment system design
- Reporting module architecture
- Performance monitoring setup
