# ContextKeeper Refactoring - Phase 1 Complete

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Removed Profile System ✅
- Deleted `ProfileDetector.cs` service
- Removed all profile JSON files from `profiles/` directory
- Simplified from multiple workflows to single unified workflow

### 2. Simplified Configuration ✅
- Updated `ContextKeeperConfig` model from v1.0 to v2.0
- Removed `WorkflowProfile` concept entirely
- Added new configuration sections:
  - `ContextTrackingConfig` for expanded context capture
  - Simplified paths to single `.contextkeeper/snapshots/` directory
  - Changed "compacted" to "archived" for clarity

### 3. Updated All Core Services ✅
- Replaced all `WorkflowProfile` parameters with `ContextKeeperConfig`
- Updated interfaces and implementations:
  - `ICompactionEngine` / `CompactionEngine`
  - `IEvolutionTracker` / `EvolutionTracker`
  - `ISearchEngine` / `SearchEngine`
  - `ISnapshotManager` / `SnapshotManager`
  - `IContextKeeperService` / `ContextKeeperService`

### 4. Created Context Capture Models ✅
- Added `DevelopmentContext.cs` with comprehensive context tracking:
  - `WorkspaceContext` - open files, cursor positions, recent commands
  - `GitContext` - branch, commits, uncommitted changes
  - `FileContext` - individual file state
  - `CommandHistory` - terminal command tracking
  - `ContextMetadata` - system and project information

### 5. Updated JSON Serialization ✅
- Added all new models to `ContextKeeperJsonContext`
- Ensured Native AOT compatibility

## What's Next

### High Priority Tasks
1. **Update SnapshotManager** to capture the expanded `DevelopmentContext`
2. **Add Git Integration** - hooks for auto-capture on commits/checkouts
3. **Update CLI** - remove manual snapshot command, add `init` command
4. **Update MCP Tools** - simplify and add evolution-focused tools

### Medium Priority Tasks
5. **Auto-compaction** - implement automatic compaction based on age/count
6. **Update Tests** - fix all tests to work with new simplified structure

### Future Enhancements
- Visual timeline interface
- Context recovery/time travel
- IDE extensions
- Team collaboration features

## Breaking Changes
- Configuration file format changed from v1.0 to v2.0
- Removed support for multiple workflow profiles
- Changed directory structure from `.contextkeeper/<workflow>/snapshots/` to `.contextkeeper/snapshots/`
- Changed snapshot naming from `<PREFIX>_<date>_<milestone>.md` to `SNAPSHOT_<date>_<type>_<milestone>.md`

## Migration Notes
For existing projects:
1. Move snapshots from `.contextkeeper/*/snapshots/` to `.contextkeeper/snapshots/`
2. Rename snapshot files to new format
3. Delete old `contextkeeper.config.json` - new one will be auto-created
4. Run `contextkeeper init` to set up git hooks (once implemented)
