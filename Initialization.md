Context: I'm working on fixing the remaining test failures in ContextKeeper. In the last session, we reduced
  failures from 35 to 16 (54% improvement). The key fixes and remaining issues are documented in CLAUDE.md.

  Current Status:
  - 81 tests passing, 16 failing (out of 97 total)
  - Build has 0 warnings, 0 errors
  - Test solution upgraded from .NET 8 to .NET 9 to match main project

  Remaining Test Failures (grouped by root cause):
  1. Test Isolation Issues (7 tests) - Tests are creating files like contextkeeper.config.json that pollute the
  environment for other tests
  2. CodeAnalysis/Roslyn Issues (6 tests) - Generic type handling and pattern matching problems in symbol search
  3. Profile Detection Issues (3 tests) - Integration tests failing on profile auto-detection

  Key Patterns Already Established:
  - Always use Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), relativePath) for file operations
  - Test data is in tests/ContextKeeper.Tests/TestData/
  - The test solution has been updated to .NET 9

  Request: Please continue fixing the remaining 16 test failures, starting with the test isolation issues since
  they're causing the most failures. The contextkeeper.config.json file is being created by some tests and
  affecting others - this needs to be addressed first.
